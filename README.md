# Core

## What is Core Repository?
The Core repository is both the foundation for Tanzu editions and a set of
building blocks that can be used to extend Tanzu. The Core repository enables
APIs, code, and documentation to be shared.

This model provides a few primary benefits.

* Enables re-use of existing work in Tanzu editions. 
* Improvements to the "core" benefits all editions.
* Fosters cross-team collaboration.
* Allows extensions to Tanzu to be built following the same patterns as core
  components of Tanzu.

## Why it is important?
It acts as the foundation for Tanzu editions enabling the re-use of the existing work
in core.


## What does this repository contain?
The core repository acts as the central location for APIs, controllers,
documentation, and CLI plugins used by all Tanzu editions.

# Tanzu CLI

## Summary
SIG CLI/API's objective is to support building CLI and API experiences within Tanzu, built on a shared framework to enable a consistent, unified Tanzu product experience for our users. We have designed the CLI around a pluggable model to support a broader set of the Tanzu portfolio‚Äôs products as they are ready to adopt it.

For more detail, please see the [Tanzu CLI purpose doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X34ZNkPG_kEMSySpFjAQsmX2Xn1dXTksbVxXUgUk-QM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Overview
The CLI is based on a plugin architecture. This architecture enables teams to build, own, and release their own piece of functionality as well as enable external partners to integrate with the system.

For more detail, please see the [Tanzu CLI architecture doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCarTtSUxJzYJweiHsOQhObTc2L4f9smAXAlIheMFfI/edit#).
Additionally, an architectual diagram is available on [confluence](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/TKG/Tanzu+CLI+Architecture+and+components).

## Contribution

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The first step to contributing is to come say hello at [SIG meetings](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/CNA/SIG+CLI-API). You can also join the [slack channel](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/C016NB72DQW) or take a peek at our [issues](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-private/core/issues). 

The [plugin author guide](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CNA&title=End-to-End+CLI+Plugin+Creation+Process) provides details on the getting the process started, but in short:
* The core framework and components are written in go
* Every plugin requires a README that explains its usage.
* Core plugins are required to conform to [design guidance](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-private/core/blob/main/docs/cli/style_guide.md) to ensure a consistent user experience.
* The plugin will live in an approved repo to enable review and testing.
* Every CLI plugin requires a [nested test executable](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-private/core/blob/main/docs/cli/plugin_implementation_guide.md#tests).

Non-core/3rd party plugins are welcome and encouraged, and can be added by users via `tanzu plugin repo add NAME`.  
Note that non-core plugins will not be included in plugin distributions distributed by VMware and commands will be namespaced differently in help.

For more detail, please see the [Tanzu CLI Implementation Guide](/docs/cli/plugin_implementation_guide.md)
